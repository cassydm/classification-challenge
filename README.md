Module 13 Challenge due 8/19/24. Created by Cassy Miller


This module takes creates two models, a Logrithmic Regression and a Random Forest to build ML that determines if an email is spam.

Using email data from UCI, the data is scaled, split and fit to each model and predictions are created and tested for accuracy. The conclusion is that both models got high scores, with Random Forest just beating Logrithmic by a percentage point.
